# .NET Standard

This repository contains the principles and definition of the .NET Standard.

.NET Standard solves the code sharing problem for .NET developers across all
platforms by bringing all the APIs that you expect and love across the
environments that you need: desktop applications, mobile apps & games, and cloud
services:

* .NET Standard is a set of APIs that all .NET platforms have to implement. This
  unifies the .NET platforms and prevents future fragmentation.
* .NET Standard 2.0 will be implemented by .NET Framework, .NET Core, and
  Xamarin. For .NET Core, this will add many of the existing APIs that have been
  requested.
* .NET Standard 2.0 includes a compatibility shim for .NET Framework binaries,
  significantly increasing the set of libraries that you can reference from your
  .NET Standard libraries.
* .NET Standard will replace Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) as the tooling
  story for building multi-platform .NET libraries.
